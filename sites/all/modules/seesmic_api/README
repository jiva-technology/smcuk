Seesmic is a video conversation platform. Seesmic API module provides a Drupal wrapper for Seesmic API (see more about on their wiki).

Seesmic API module exports 2 functions :

seesmic_api_show_recorder ( $reply_to_id = '' ) this function will printout inside a div seesmic recorder.
seesmic_api_show_player ( $dsvid ) where dsvid is the internal video identifier (Drupal Seesmic Video IDentifier).

When a video has been recorded, it will be stored inside a table and a hook will be called. To implement this hook, simply create, inside your module a function ending by _seesmic_api.

The module cannot be used as it, mainly designed to provide an entry point for other modules inside Seesmic universe.

We're currently releasing a Seeslmic comments module.
