msgid "You may allow this container and all categories within it to be exported in a variety of formats. The number of export options available depends on what export modules you have installed. Users will only be able to perform the exports that they have access to (as defined on the access control page). Additionally, if this container or any categories within it has distant children, then those children will be included in an export, if the relevant export is enabled for that container as well."

So book-export modules, such as export_dxml and export_opml, will not be listed here."
