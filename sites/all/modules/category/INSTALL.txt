Requirements
------------

This module requires the latest development version of Drupal (CVS HEAD).


Installation
------------

1. Copy the category folder and its contents to the Drupal modules/ directory.
   Drupal should automatically detect it.

2. Go to 'administer -> modules' and enable category (and category_menu,
   category_display, category_export, and category_legacy, if applicable).
   Note: for each module that you enable, all necessary database tables will
   be automatically created, using Drupal's new .install file system. You no
   longer need to run the category.mysql script (which is why this file no
   longer exists).

3. If you wish to use taxonomy-dependent Drupal modules (e.g. forum, image,
   glossary) with this module, you must install the taxonomy wrapper module.
   There is now a script available to perform this installation for you. To
   run the script, go to 'administer -> settings -> category', and in the
   'wrapper install / uninstall settings' box, click the 'install now' link
   for the taxonomy wrapper. If you experience errors with this script (usually
   due to file system permissions problems), see the instructions for
   installing the wrapper modules manually (available online).

4. If you wish to use book-dependent Drupal modules (e.g. export_dxml) with
   this module, you must install the book wrapper module. The procedure for
   doing this is similar to that for installing the taxonomy wrapper module.
   To run the book wrapper installation script, go to 'administer -> settings
   -> category', and in the 'wrapper install / uninstall settings' box, click
   the 'install now' link for the book wrapper. If you experience errors with
   this script (usually due to file system permissions problems), see the
   instructions for installing the wrapper modules manually (available online).

5. If you have existing taxonomy terms and vocabularies, or if you have
   existing book nodes, you can import them as categories and containeris using
   category_legacy. To do this, go to 'administer -> category legacy', and
   follow the instructions on that page. It is recommended that you enable the
   taxonomy and book wrappers before performing an import. Additionally, using
   the taxonomy wrapper with existing taxonomy data is not recommended - either
   import your existing taxonomy data first, disable the taxonomy wrapper, or
   delete your site's taxonomy data. You are able to leave the book module
   enabled, and continue to use your book data, if you wish (but as with
   taxonomy, it is recommended that you disable book).

6. Go to 'administer -> access control' to configure access privileges for
   this module.

7. Go to 'administer -> settings -> category' to change the settings for this
   module. You might also want to change the node type settings for the
   category and container node types, at 'administer -> settings -> content
   types'.

8. Go to 'administer -> categories' to start managing your categories and
   containers. You can create new categories and containers from here, or
   you can go to 'create content -> category' or 'create content -> container'.

9. You can assign content to categories by configuring your containers to be
   associated with various node types, and then creating or editing nodes of
   those types.
   Note: content with assigned categories will only have its categories
   displayed if category_display is installed, and if your containers are
   configured to show categories on assigned nodes, and if the taxonomy
   wrapper is installed.
