You can also export containers and categories back to the taxonomy and book modules. It is strongly recommended that you back up all existing taxonomy and book data on your site, before performing any operations using this module.</p><p>This module requires the category module.</p>"

msgid "For each vocabulary that you select, the vocabulary and all its terms will be imported into the category system. Vocabularies will become containers, and terms will become categories. Vocabularies and terms have their own vocabulary and term IDs, whereas categories and containers use the more standard node IDs; therefore, in order to avoid any possible conflict in sequencing, everything that you import will be given a new node ID, and will lose its old vocabulary or term ID."

msgid "<strong>Warning:</strong> all vocabularies and terms that you import will be deleted from the taxonomy database tables! If you have the taxonomy wrapper installed, then they will all be re-inserted, and will be untouched except for having new IDs, to match your newly imported categories and containers. If you have any doubts, you should enable the 'backup all selected data' option before proceeding."
