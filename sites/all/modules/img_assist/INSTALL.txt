  Administer > Site building > Modules

* Configure an input format and enable the filter 'Inline images' by visiting:

  Administer > Site configuration > Input formats

  If you want to enable Inline images for the input format 'Filtered HTML',
  you additionally need to click the 'Configure' tab and add

  <span> <img>

  to the text field 'Allowed HTML tags'.

  Administer > User management > Access control

  Administer > Site configuration > Image assist

  want your users to be able to easily choose images from their galleries, select
  for example "Acidfree albums" as the vocabulary to use for Image assist.

* If Wysiwyg Editor module is installed, you need to edit your Wysiwyg profile
  configuration and enable the plugin for Image Assist.
